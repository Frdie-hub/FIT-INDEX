"• Protein: chicken, eggs, fish, Greek yogurt, tofu, lentils, whey protein\n" +

"🏋️‍♂️ **2. Strength Training (3–5x/week)**\n" +

"📆 Sample Weekly Split:\n" +

"• Compound lifts: Squats, deadlifts, bench press, pull-ups, rows, overhead press\n" +
"• Accessory work: Dumbbell curls, lateral raises, triceps extensions\n" +

"😴 **3. Recovery and Sleep**\n" +
"• Get 7–9 hours of quality sleep\n" +
"• Take rest days seriously\n" +
"• Avoid overtraining — recovery is key to muscle growth\n\n" +
