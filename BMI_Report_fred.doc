💪 DO NOT WORRY — WE WILL GET THERE!

🚦 **Key Principles for Exercising with Obesity**
• Start slow: Focus on low-impact activities
• Prioritize joint-friendly moves: Avoid high-impact running or jumping
• Build endurance gradually: Short sessions with rest as needed
• Combine cardio + strength for best results
• Focus on consistency over intensity

🏃‍♂️ **Recommended Exercises**

1. **Walking**
   • Start with 10–15 minutes at a comfortable pace
   • Gradually increase duration and speed
   • Use a treadmill or flat outdoor paths

2. **Water Aerobics / Swimming**
   • Reduces joint impact
   • Builds cardiovascular health
   • Try classes or swim laps at your pace

3. **Cycling (Stationary or Outdoor)**
   • Low-impact, gentle on knees/hips
   • Start with 10–20 minutes and build up

4. **Chair Exercises / Seated Workouts**
   • Arm raises, leg lifts, seated marching
   • Good for building strength with limited mobility

5. **Strength Training (2–3x/week)**
   • Use bodyweight or resistance bands
   • Focus on major muscle groups: legs, chest, back, core
   • Examples: wall push-ups, seated leg lifts, band rows

6. **Gentle Yoga or Stretching**
   • Improve flexibility, reduce stiffness
   • Supports balance and posture

📋 **Sample Beginner Weekly Routine**

• Wednesday: Rest or water aerobics/swimming
• Thursday: 15–20 min cycling or walking

📝 **Additional Tips**
• Warm up and cool down with 5–10 minutes of light movement
• Wear supportive footwear
• Listen to your body — stop if you feel pain
• Set small, realistic goals (e.g., +5 minutes walking each week)
• Consult your healthcare provider before starting
